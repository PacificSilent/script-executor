# Script Executor

A lightweight Node.js and Express API for remotely executing batch scripts, built primarily for automation. This documentation provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and security considerations.

## Overview

The script-executor is designed to enable the remote triggering of batch scripts via a RESTful API. The service offers a simple yet robust interface that can be integrated into various automation workflows. With a focus on ease of use and efficiency, this solution is ideal for systems that require centralized control over script execution.

## Features

- **Remote Execution:** Trigger batch scripts through HTTP requests.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal dependencies and a straightforward design.
- **Built on Node.js & Express:** Leverages popular frameworks for reliability and scalability.
- **Extensible:** Easily integrate and customize for advanced automation needs.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- Express (included as a dependency)
- A Windows-based environment with support for batch script execution

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PacificSilent/script-executor.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```
   cd script-executor
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Adjust the configuration as needed:

- All batch configurations are done in the `scripts-config.json` file.
- Modify `server.js` or the relevant configuration files to set up your batch script execution paths.
- Configure security measures, such as authentication, to protect access to the API.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. **API Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint:** `/execute-script`
   - **Method:** POST
   - **Request Body Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "scriptName": "exampleScript.bat",
       "parameters": ["param1", "param2"]
     }
     ```
3. **Response**
   A successful API call returns a JSON response indicating the execution status of the script.

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation:** Always validate incoming parameters to prevent unauthorized script execution.
- **Authentication:** Implement authentication (e.g., API keys or tokens) to secure the API.
- **Environment Isolation:** Consider running the API within a secure, isolated environment to reduce risk.
